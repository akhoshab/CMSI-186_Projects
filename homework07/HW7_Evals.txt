Your code did not compile.  I clearly stated in class that if it doesn't
compile, I cannot give you any credit.

Your code is not JavaDoc'd either.  I clearly stated in class that you
MUST JavaDoc your code for this assignment.

Since your code doesn't compile, I can't run any of the tests in the
test harness, so I can't give you credit for those, either.

These were all things that I talked about in class several times.
