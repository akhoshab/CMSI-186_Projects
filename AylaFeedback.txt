Here is feedback on your code.

Homework 0:
-----------
   You don't have any file header.  Granted, it doesn't really serve much
   purpose in this small program, but it's a good habit to get into

   Your file is named "Hello.java" but the name of the class inside the
   file is "Greeter".  This will not compile.  Either change the name of
   the class INSIDE the file to "Hello" or [better] change the name of the
   file OUTSIDE to "Greeter.java".  THEY MUST MATCH.

   Also remember, if you have any constructors defined, THEIR NAMES MUST
   MATCH THESE AS WELL.


Homework 1:
-----------
   There is a lot of "cruft" in your code.  When you have code that is in
   the file but has been rendered useless by commenting it, it's distracting
   to the person reading the code.  You should ALWAYS remove that "cruft"
   in your final version of your code.  This is especially true when using
   GitHub, because you can always compare versions side-by-side and see how
   things have changed.

   The switch in your "toMonthString()" method could be a lot shorter if you
   simply return the string desired:

      switch( month - 1 ) {
         case JANUARY: return "January";
         case FEBRUARY: return "February";
           .... etc. ....

   Same thing for "toDayOfWeekString()"

   For "CountTheDays", since the args are in an array, you could also define
   the date values as an array of longs, and do the conversion in a loop.
   That would make your code more succinct.


Homework 2:
-----------
   Again, watch the "cruft".

   In your palindrome method, you could tighten the code a bit by simply
   returning if the two characters are NOT equal.  If the comparison fails,
   simply return false.  You can also move the increment/decrement statements
   to be inside the parens of the comparison statement.

   Be sure to spell check your comments.

   Be sure your indenting is consistent, even with the closing curly braces
   at the end of "if" and "for" statement blocks.

   In your "evensOnlyNoDupes()" and your "oddsOnlyNoDupes()" methods, the
   use of the Set class seems totally extraneous, except that you are using
   it to check if you have already logged that character.  While this works,
   it's not the most intuitive use of a Set....
